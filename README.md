**Problem:** Have you ever wondered if Test-Driven Development actually improves code quality? There is a lot of evidence documented in Research papers but this is unavailable to many commercial software engineers because it is behind a paywall, is written in unfamiliar academic language and it is high effort to find the trends.

**Solve it with SEER:** Simply search for "TDD" and "code quality", then browse a list of empirical research articles related to this with a summary of each related to the study, the measures and the results.
